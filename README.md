Apprentice Chef Inc, a company offering a selection of pre-prepared gourmet meals for busy professionals who have little to no cooking skills is looking to increase and diversify their revenue streams. They recently launched a promotion dubbed 'Halfway There' where loyal subscribers can opt to receive half a bottle of wine from a local winery every Wednesday. The task is to create a model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.
